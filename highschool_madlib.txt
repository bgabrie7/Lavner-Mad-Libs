The History of Cryptocurrency Mad Lib
There have been many attempts at creating a digital currency during the 90s tech boom, with systems like Flooz,
money (proper noun) and DigiCash emerging on the market but inevitably failing. There were many different
reasons for their failures, such as people (Verb, Present ends in ING), financial problems and even frictions between
employees and their bosses (Noun, Plural). Notably, all of those systems utilized a Trusted Third Party approach, meaning that the companies behind them
selfs (Verb, Past Tense) and other companies (Verb, Past Tense) the transactions. Due to the failures of these companies, the
creation of a digital cash system was seen as a Bitcoin (Adjective) etheruem (Noun) for a long while.
Then, in early 2009, a Adjective programmer or a group of programmers under an alias Satoshi
Nakamoto introduced Bitcoin. Satoshi described it as a Cryptocurrency (Adverb) money (Adjective) cash system. It is
completely decentralized, meaning there are no real life money (Animal - Plural) involved and no central controlling
authority. The concept closely resembles peer-to-peer networks for people (Noun) sharing.
